This repository contains sample code to be considered for the DIME recruitment drive ( in October 2022.)

-Uruguay 
- This folder contains the code to produce RDD estimates robustness to different bandwidth selections. This is part of my co-authored project “Electronic Payment Technology and Tax Compliance:
Evidence from Uruguay’s Financial Inclusion Reform”. The data is not public, so this folder contains no data. The output subfolder contains the stata output, as well as a tex file creating a publication-ready figures and its respective compiled PDF. 

- Enigh Mexico 2020
- Given that the data for most of my recent projects is not publicly available, I decided to show something with some household data. This exercise does not intend to be a comprehensive and valid analysis. In summary, I am identifying groups of sibilings within a household and compared some schooling and health otucomes based on their mother teen pregnancy status. The sample is limited to those individuals who reside in the same household with their mothers. The do file shows some data management and the creation of fully customizable tables and figures. Similar to the Uruguay folder, the output folder contains the stata output, a tex file and its respective compiled PDF.
